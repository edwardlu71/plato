Plato Project
=============

***Plato*** is a workshop project I wrote for the purpose to develop the framework to find the best practice to move systems to container based infra, the roadmap to docker/kubernetes/openshift in cloud.

It is a simple application on django framework, with interfaces display market data of indices, forex and equity market and their charts. It also has a simple blog function.
